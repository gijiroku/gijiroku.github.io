<p>I quote from the beginning of the material.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This book is designed to help Japanese language learners (hereafter referred to as learners) acquire the Japanese language as a tool by &quot;listening, imitating (repeat), and speaking (talking about themselves)&quot; to the Japanese spoken by Japanese language supporters (hereafter referred to as supporters) and Japanese language teachers, using supplementary teaching material illustrations as well.</p>
<p>In these activities, supporters are asked to use &quot;easy Japanese&quot; and &quot;listen&quot; closely to the learners in order to communicate with them in Japanese. We hope that you will support learners in learning &quot;Japanese that leads to the power to live,&quot; so that they can take their first step toward connecting with society with confidence and live better lives.</p>
<p>We hope that everyone who uses this text will have a lively and enjoyable experience communicating in Japanese.</blockquote></p>
